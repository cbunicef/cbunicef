Hi, I’m @cbunicef. 

Outside of GitHub, I'm Christopher Brooks - UNICEF's Global Lead for the Internet Of Good Things (IoGT). I'm also a Social and Behavior Change Specialist in UNICEF's Programme Group.

You can learn more about IoGT at http://www.goodinternet.org, see it in action at https://www.internetofgoodthings.org/ and contribute to its development at https://github.com/unicef/iogt.
